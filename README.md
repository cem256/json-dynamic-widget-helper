# JSON Dynamic Widget Helper (WIP)

## Overview

JSON Dynamic Widget Helper is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to assist developers working with the [`json_dynamic_widget`](https://pub.dev/packages/json_dynamic_widget) package for Flutter. This extension is currently in its early stages of development and is a work in progress (WIP).

## Features

This extension provides tools to manipulate JSON structures used with the [`json_dynamic_widget`](https://pub.dev/packages/json_dynamic_widget) package, making it easier to:

- Wrap existing widgets with new parent widgets (e.g., Column, Row, or custom widgets)
- Remove selected widget from from the tree

## Status

⚠️ **Early Development Stage** ⚠️

This extension is in its initial development phase. Features may be incomplete or subject to significant changes.

## Usage

To trigger the extension:

1. Open a JSON file in VS Code.
2. Select the "type" key of a widget you want to modify.
3. Press `Cmd + .` (Mac) or `Ctrl + .` (Windows/Linux)
4. A menu will appear with options to wrap or remove the selected widget
